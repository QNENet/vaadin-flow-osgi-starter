# vaadin-flow-osgi-starter
Repository to investigate creating Vaadin 12 OSGi projects in Bndtools Workspace

Jars have NOT been uploaded into this repo so you need to download this file and unzip into cnf/local
https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/qnenet/vaadinFlow/local.zip

The files in the zip were copied from a maven install of the Vaadin OSGi starter project.

I could not get the project to resolve so I commented out the 
#-resolve.effective: active
This is probably the wrong thing to do...

The system compiles and runs but has Vaadin errors.
