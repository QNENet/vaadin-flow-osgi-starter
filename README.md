# vaadin-flow-osgi-starter
Repository to investigate creating Vaadin 12 OSGi projects in Bndtools Workspace


The bundles in the local repo were copied from a maven install of the Vaadin OSGi starter project.

I could not get the project to resolve so I commented out the 
#-resolve.effective: active
This is probably the wrong thing to do...

The system compiles and runs but has Vaadin errors.
